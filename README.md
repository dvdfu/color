Made for the [#ExplorablesJam](https://explorabl.es/jam/).

## Setup

Have npm installed locally.

Install `webpack-dev-server` through npm. This transpiles ES6 source code and also deploys local servers for testing. Then install the required node modules.

```sh
npm install webpack-dev-server -g
npm install
```

To run:

```sh
webpack-dev-server
# visit localhost:8080
```
